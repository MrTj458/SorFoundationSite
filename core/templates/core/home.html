    <p class="lead text-white">
      We work with community partners to help provide low income children under
      the age of 18 with a premiere music education experience. The children
      receive weekly private and/or group music lessons at our after-school
      music programs. Because music erases socioeconomic differences, this
      experience connects kids from all different backgrounds. If you can play
      your instrument well, opportunities abound. Our program facilitates
      scholarships for all levels of skill, based on passion and financial need.
      Parents tell us that music school has completely transformed their child
      from being shy and awkward, to being confident, having good friends,
      learning that hard work (practicing) pays off, and improving academically.
      For kids with limited prospects, music education can change their entire
      future.
